# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- `create-issue.md` drafted labels in body text but never passed `--label` to `gh issue create`. Now runs `gh label list` first and passes labels via `--label` flags.

### Added
- `orient.md` command — cold-session orientation with repo context, structure, and next-action guidance
- Prompt injection protection in `researcher.md` — fetched content treated as untrusted; embedded instructions flagged before execution
- `.gitignore` — excludes `settings.local.json` (project-specific) and `*.lock` runtime files

### Fixed
- `ship.md` and `tester.md` hardcoded `origin/master` in git diff ranges, causing empty output for projects using `main` as the default branch. Now detects the base branch dynamically via `git symbolic-ref` (then `git remote show origin`, then `master` as last resort).
